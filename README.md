# My stolen evil emacs files
I borrowed very heavily from a few sources for this. I'm linking to  their repos below so anyone that finds this can get to the original sources.
I had to make some changes to accomodate how I wanted things and for updated packages, but the core is still the same.


## From Daniel Higginbotham's Clojure for the Brave and True [repo](https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs-for-clojure)
You should definitely check out his [Clojure for the Brave and True](http://www.braveclojure.com/). It's a great intro to clojure. 

## From Drew Warner's [repo](https://github.com/wernerandrew/jedi-starter)
He has a really good youtube video explaining this setup [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BlTGPsjGJk)

I also use evil mode because vim is a great text editor. I set the leader key to SPC because I think spacemacs got that right, but that package was just a bit too bloated for me.
